# Execution of the tutorials

The [IAA-CSIC Severo Ochoa Center](http://so.iaa.csic.es/) provides a JupyterHub server available during the duration of the school here:

[https://spsrc-jupyter.iaa.csic.es/sostat2021/](https://spsrc-jupyter.iaa.csic.es/sostat2021/)

Login with the credentials provided to you. These instances will have persistent storage throughout the duration of the school. **All virtual machines and their contents will be removed by the 2021-12-12.**. In case of any problem, please fill an [issue here](https://github.com/spsrc/sostat2021/issues) or ask in the #help Slack channel.


# Two alternative ways to execute the tutorials


## 1. In your local machine

### Install conda

We recommend using `conda` to manage the dependencies. Miniconda is a light-weight version of Anaconda. First we show how to install Miniconda if you don't have it already. More details [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html)

You can skip this step if you already have conda available in your path.

Miniconda for Linux:
```bash
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
rm ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Miniconda for macOS:
```bash
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
rm Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

That is all, `conda` should be available in your path. Note that the installation will suggest you to modify your bashrc so conda is always available, which is a good idea in general. Alternatively, if you want the Miniconda installation to be encapsulated in your working directory without affecting the rest of your system you can install it with the following option. The first command only needs to be done once, and the second one needs to be done everytime you open a new terminal. 

```bash
cd /your/working/directory/
bash ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p my_conda_env
source my_conda_env/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
```

### Get the contents of the school

Download this repository and create the conda environment with the dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spsrc/sostat2021.git
cd sostat2021
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sostat2021
```

If you want to use Jupyer Lab, start it and navigate to `tutorials/index.html` with:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

## 2. Using the myBinder cloud

At any moment, also after the school, you can still run the tutorials in [myBinder.org](https://mybinder.org) following this link: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/spsrc/sostat2021/HEAD?urlpath=lab/tree/tutorials/index.ipynb)

[myBinder.org](https://mybinder.org) is a free and open organization providing free cloud resources. Therefore, the resources may be limited and the changes you make in the notebooks or the system are not persistent. Please, always keep a local copy of any file you want to keep, because Binder will automatically eliminate the virtual machine assigned to you after some time of inactivity.

## 3. Deploy with Docker

To deploy the same environment used in SOSTAT2021 you can create your own docker container following the instructions described[here](./deployment/).
