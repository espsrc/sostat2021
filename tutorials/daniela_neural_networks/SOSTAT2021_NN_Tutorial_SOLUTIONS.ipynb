    "# A Tutorial on Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we're going to translate some of the concepts that we've been talking about in the lecture part into code. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Exercise** (to do at home): it is really, really instructive to write your own code implement and train a neural network, including the backpropagation and gradient descent. I highly encourage you to do so, for your own understanding of the subject matter. However, this would take more time than we have today, so today we'll use an existing library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural Network Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "There are basically two major libraries for neural networks: [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) (designed and supported by Google) and [torch](http://torch.ch) (originally used by the Facebook AI Research group). These libraries realistically underpin the vast majority of neural network-based machine learning applications today. A third open-source library, theano, existed, but has been moved to the [aesara](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aesara) project and is primarily maintained to support a probabilistic modeling package called [pymc3](https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/) (check it out! it's very cool!). \n",
    "\n",
    "Which package you use depends, to some extent, on personal preference. While I mentioned above that you should absolutely try two write your own basic implementation of a  neural network, I probably wouldn't suggest to use it for actual research (or other) applications. Both tensorflow and torch are well-supported packages that are heavily optimized to make training neural networks fast and efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both tensorflow and torch contain lower-level functionality that underpins a lot of the clever optimization. One of them is high-performance numerical computing (e.g. with the [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) library). Similarly, there are higher-level layers built on top of tensorflow and torch that make model-building in practice a lot easier and more efficient. Of particular interest to you might be [keras](https://keras.io), which is built on top of tensorflow, and [pytorch](https://pytorch.org), which provides a python interface layer to torch. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, Bayesian inference is really hard because the posterior is usually analytically intractable, and methods to approximate it are often slow and computationally expensive. There has been a recent push to make some of the infrastructure and insights of building efficient machine learning algorithms for probabilistic inference, and there are now some relatively new packages that implement some of these new ideas. PyMC3, as mentioned above, has been doing this for a long time, but is now joined by [edward2](https://github.com/google/edward2) (built on tensorflow) and [pyro](http://pyro.ai) (built on torch). \n",

    "## Learning Hand-Written Digits\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture, we explored how we might theoretically train a computer to recognize handwritten digits. Let's now explore this in code. The [MNIST Handwritten Digits Database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is a great resource to get started: it's a very well-studied, extremely well-curated dataset. It doesn't have a lot of weird data issues and biases that you might encounter in real data sets where you're likely to apply machine learning (as we've seen yesterday, the photo-z data set has quite a few strange quirks). It's a widely used benchmark for machine learning algorithms. As of writing this tutorial, top performance stands at 99.87% (see [this website](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-mnist)), using a model witih around 1.5 million parameters. Let's see how close we can get today?\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimenting with the MNIST handwritten digits dataset has the advantage that it helps you understand how the algorithms work, and how different choices affect the classification accuracy. However, you should be aware that it also makes it pretty *easy* to implement and run a neural network and get a good result. In reality, designing, developing, testing and improving machine learning models can be a long, arduous process that requires a lot of creativity, digging into the data and experimentation. Don't get discouraged if you try this on astronomy data and it doesn't work right away!\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, let's load the MNIST data. PyTorch has a bunch of datasets pre-loaded, which makes things pretty easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time you run the command below, it will download the requisite data to whatever path you specify in `root`. PyTorch has already helpfully split the training and the test data sets, so we can load them separately by setting `train=True` for the training data set, and `train=False` for the test data set. We'll also have to set `download=True` the first time we run this, but not the next time (if you rerun this notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can't use the input data as it's being provided, we need to transform both the pixel values of the images, and the labels. Firs, the `ToTensor()` transform moves the data from numpy arrays to pytorch tensors so that PyTorch can use them. Secondly, by default, the labels are stored as numbers from 0 to 9 (i.e. the number that's being displayed on the image). We're going to work with two different cases below. First, we'll look at logistic regression as a *binary* classifier. For this we're just going to answer the question \"Is it a 4?\". If the answer is \"yes\", then we'll give that label a value of 1, if it's no, the label will have a value of 0. Later on, we'll look at all of the classes with a different encoding of the labels. We can implement this by using a `Lambda` transform. `lambda` in general is a Python way to encode functions on the fly on a single like without the traditional `def function_name(parameters) ...` type syntax. PyTorch has its own version of that implemented as a transform. \n",

This linear model is stored for use in `forward`. \n",

    "## A Neural Network for SDSS Photometric Redshifts\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've looked at how to design a neural network for the MNIST data, let's look at some astronomy data:  SDSS photometric redshifts! Getting redshifts for galaxies is both time-consuming and intensive: for far-away galaxies, one might need hours of integration on a spectrograph to get a good enough spectrum redshift estimate. At the same time, large surveys like SDSS and, in the future, LSST, generate *huge* amounts of data of galaxies. However, they only collect *photometric* data: they collect magnitudes in multiple filters. These filters are, in practice, an integral over the multiplication of the underlying spectrum with the filter response. The question is: can we get (good enough) redshifts from these photometric measurements? \n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to tackle this problem. One is to use *template-matching*. For this, one assumes a physical model for how the combination of stars and other sources in a galaxy generate the emission, and how this emission is redshifted as a function of distance. One can then fit a model that has redshift as a parameter. More complex versions of this type of modelling build sophisticated (Bayesian) statistical models that infer the galaxy properties along with the redshift. There is a strong assumption in this model, though: it assumes that we have a good enough physical model of how the intrinsic emission of galaxies is generated as a function of their evolution that we can generate realistic templates. If the templates are off, our redshifts might also be wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a response, some researchers have cast this problem into a machine learning problem: take all galaxies for which we *do* have spectroscopic redshifts, and train a machine learning algorithm on the combination of (1) the photometric magnitudes (features), and (2) the spectroscopic redshifts (ground-truth labels). The hope is that this model will generalize enough to new (unseen) examples. Note that it is not clear a priori that this model will do better than a template-matching approach, because it *also* makes strong assumptions. In particular, it assumes that our training data set from current (spectroscopic) surveys is *representative* of the unknown new data we're trying to estimate redshifts for. New telescopes like the Rubin Observatory, which will generate the *Legacy Survey of Space and Time* will look deeper than current surveys, and deeper than most spectroscopic instruments can reasonably integrate to get a good enough spectrum. As a result, training data at high redshifts is very sparse, a problem that the community has worked on for a long time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we're going to explore photometric redshift estimation on SDSS data. Note that this is a *regression* task: instead of estimating a discrete class, here you will estimate a *continuous variable*. This means that your last neural network layer should *not* have an activation function. You'll also want to use a cost function that is designed for regression (the Mean Squared Error is a straightforward place to start). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we're going to need to load the data into a format that PyTorch can deal with. To do that, we will have to build our own `DataSet` class. Fear not, I will do this for you here, so that you have a bit of a template for how to possibly do this with your own data.\n",

    "**Note**: in practical applications, it can sometimes be helpful to generate a validation or test set that is at least *slightly* different from the training data set (or explore the performance on validation data sets with different properties compared to the training data). This can be helpful because in realistic applications, the real data is rarely as well-behaved as the training data. Especially in astronomy, where people commonly train models on *simulated data*, or on data from *different telescopes*, we cannot expect that the properties of the population we'd like to study are the same as that of the training data. Generating validation and test sets that test for that kind of issue can help you understand how well your model will do on real data sets.\n",
