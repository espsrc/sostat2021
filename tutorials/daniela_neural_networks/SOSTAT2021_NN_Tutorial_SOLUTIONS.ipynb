    "# A Tutorial on Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we're going to translate some of the concepts that we've been talking about in the lecture part into code. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Exercise** (to do at home): it is really, really instructive to write your own code implement and train a neural network, including the backpropagation and gradient descent. I highly encourage you to do so, for your own understanding of the subject matter. However, this would take more time than we have today, so today we'll use an existing library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural Network Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "There are basically two major libraries for neural networks: [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) (designed and supported by Google) and [torch](http://torch.ch) (originally used by the Facebook AI Research group). These libraries realistically underpin the vast majority of neural network-based machine learning applications today. A third open-source library, theano, existed, but has been moved to the [aesara](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aesara) project and is primarily maintained to support a probabilistic modeling package called [pymc3](https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/) (check it out! it's very cool!). \n",
    "\n",
    "Which package you use depends, to some extent, on personal preference. While I mentioned above that you should absolutely try two write your own basic implementation of a  neural network, I probably wouldn't suggest to use it for actual research (or other) applications. Both tensorflow and torch are well-supported packages that are heavily optimized to make training neural networks fast and efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both tensorflow and torch contain lower-level functionality that underpins a lot of the clever optimization. One of them is high-performance numerical computing (e.g. with the [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) library). Similarly, there are higher-level layers built on top of tensorflow and torch that make model-building in practice a lot easier and more efficient. Of particular interest to you might be [keras](https://keras.io), which is built on top of tensorflow, and [pytorch](https://pytorch.org), which provides a python interface layer to torch. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, Bayesian inference is really hard because the posterior is usually analytically intractable, and methods to approximate it are often slow and computationally expensive. There has been a recent push to make some of the infrastructure and insights of building efficient machine learning algorithms for probabilistic inference, and there are now some relatively new packages that implement some of these new ideas. PyMC3, as mentioned above, has been doing this for a long time, but is now joined by [edward2](https://github.com/google/edward2) (built on tensorflow) and [pyro](http://pyro.ai) (built on torch). \n",

    "## Learning Hand-Written Digits\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture, we explored how we might theoretically train a computer to recognize handwritten digits. Let's now explore this in code. The [MNIST Handwritten Digits Database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is a great resource to get started: it's a very well-studied, extremely well-curated dataset. It doesn't have a lot of weird data issues and biases that you might encounter in real data sets where you're likely to apply machine learning (as we've seen yesterday, the photo-z data set has quite a few strange quirks). It's a widely used benchmark for machine learning algorithms. As of writing this tutorial, top performance stands at 99.87% (see [this website](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-mnist)), using a model witih around 1.5 million parameters. Let's see how close we can get today?\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimenting with the MNIST handwritten digits dataset has the advantage that it helps you understand how the algorithms work, and how different choices affect the classification accuracy. However, you should be aware that it also makes it pretty *easy* to implement and run a neural network and get a good result. In reality, designing, developing, testing and improving machine learning models can be a long, arduous process that requires a lot of creativity, digging into the data and experimentation. Don't get discouraged if you try this on astronomy data and it doesn't work right away!\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, let's load the MNIST data. PyTorch has a bunch of datasets pre-loaded, which makes things pretty easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time you run the command below, it will download the requisite data to whatever path you specify in `root`. PyTorch has already helpfully split the training and the test data sets, so we can load them separately by setting `train=True` for the training data set, and `train=False` for the test data set. We'll also have to set `download=True` the first time we run this, but not the next time (if you rerun this notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can't use the input data as it's being provided, we need to transform both the pixel values of the images, and the labels. Firs, the `ToTensor()` transform moves the data from numpy arrays to pytorch tensors so that PyTorch can use them. Secondly, by default, the labels are stored as numbers from 0 to 9 (i.e. the number that's being displayed on the image). We're going to work with two different cases below. First, we'll look at logistic regression as a *binary* classifier. For this we're just going to answer the question \"Is it a 4?\". If the answer is \"yes\", then we'll give that label a value of 1, if it's no, the label will have a value of 0. Later on, we'll look at all of the classes with a different encoding of the labels. We can implement this by using a `Lambda` transform. `lambda` in general is a Python way to encode functions on the fly on a single like without the traditional `def function_name(parameters) ...` type syntax. PyTorch has its own version of that implemented as a transform. \n",

    "In order to build a logistic regression classifier in PyTorch, we need the `torch.nn.Linear` function. This function sets up--perhaps unsurprisingly--a linear model. It takes an `input dimension`, which is the dimension of a single image, if you unfolded it into a vector, and an `output dimension`, which here should be the dimensionality of our labels (10). Let's get out a single example from our training data to check:\n"

    "You then define a variable `self.lm` (the \"lm\" stands for \"linear model\", and the `self` is important for reasons we won't go into here, but makes it possible that you can call it later in `forward`), which is a linear model with the input size and output size defined by the parameters you gave to that method. This linear model is stored for use in `forward`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In that function, you pass in a sample of the (training) data, so that `x` is a single image, unravelled into a vector. This method will then take this function, put it through the linear model, and then squash the entire thing through a sigmoid function. It will then return the output of that function, which should be a value between 0 and 1 and will be our predicted label. And there we go, we have a logistic regression model!\n",

    "**Note**: in practical applications, it can sometimes be helpful to generate a validation or test set that is at least *slightly* different from the training data set (or explore the performance on validation data sets with different properties compared to the training data). This can be helpful because in realistic applications, the real data is rarely as well-behaved as the training data. Especially in astronomy, where people commonly train models on *simulated data*, or on data from *different telescopes*, we cannot expect that the properties of the population we'd like to study are the same as that of the training data. Generating validation and test sets that test for that kind of issue can help you understand how well your model will do on real data sets.\n",
